### Who We Are and What This Policy Covers

Our mission is to democratize Natural Language Processing, we beleive the biggest challange to NLP adoption is a lack of training data. This Privacy Policy applies to information that we collect about you when you use:

Throughout this Privacy Policy we’ll refer to the applicable websites and other products and services collectively as “Services.” Below we explain how we collect, use, and share information about you, along with the choices that you have with respect to that information. Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to any of our products or services that have a separate privacy policy. If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please [contact us](mailto:privacypolicyupdates@LightTag.io).

### Information We Collect

We only collect information about you if we have a reason to do so–for example, to provide our Services, to communicate with you, or to make our Services better. We collect information in three ways: if and when you provide information to us, automatically through operating our services, and from outside sources. Let’s go over the information that we collect.

#### **_Information You Provide to Us_**

It’s probably no surprise that we collect information that you provide to us. The amount and type of information depends on the context and how we use the information. Here are some examples:

*   **Basic Account Information:** We ask for basic information from you in order to set up your account. For example, we require individuals who sign up for a [LightTag.io](http://www.LightTag.io/) account to provide a username and email address–and that’s it. You may provide us with more information–like your name–but we don’t require that information to create your account.
*   **Transaction and Billing Information:** If you buy something from us–a subscription to a LightTag.io plan for example–you will provide additional personal and payment information that is required to process the transaction and your payment, such as your name, credit card information, and contact information.
*   **Content Information:** You may also provide us with information about you or others in data you upload for annotation. For example, if you upload emails for annotation containing biographic information about you, we will have that information. This might be obvious to you...but it’s not to everyone!
*   **Communications with Us (Hi There!):** You may also provide us information when you respond to surveys, communicate with our Happiness Engineers about a support question, or post a question about your project in our public forums.

#### **_Information We Collect Automatically_**

We also collect some information automatically:

*   **Log Information:** Like most online service providers, we collect information that web browsers, mobile devices, and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, IP address, unique device identifiers, language preference, referring site, the date and time of access, operating system, and mobile network information. We collect log information when you use our Services–for example, when you make an annotation  on LightTag.
*   **Usage Information:** We collect information about your usage of our Services. For example, we collect information about the actions that project administrators and annotators perform on a project–in other words, who did what, when and to what thing on a project (e.g., \[LightTag.io username\] annotated “\[example\]” at \[time/date\]). We also collect information about what happens when you use our Services (e.g., page views, support document searches at guide.LightTag.io, button clicks) along with information about your device (e.g., mobile screen size, name of cellular network, and mobile device manufacturer). We use this information to, for example, provide our Services to you, as well as get insights on how people use our Services, so we can make our Services better.
*   **Information from Cookies & Other Technologies:** A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Pixel tags (also called web beacons) are small blocks of code placed on websites and e-mails. LightTag uses cookies and other technologies like pixel tags to help us identify and track visitors, usage, and access preferences for our Services, as well as track and understand e-mail campaign effectiveness and to deliver targeted ads.


### How We Use Information

We use information about you as mentioned above and as follows:

*   To provide our Services–for example, to set up and maintain your account, host your website, backup and restore your website, or charge you for any of our paid Services;
*   To further develop our Services–for example by adding new features that we think our users will enjoy or will help them to create and manage their websites more efficiently;
*   To monitor and analyze trends and better understand how users interact with our Services, which helps us improve our Services and make them easier to use;
*   To monitor and protect the security of our Services, detect and prevent fraudulent transactions and other illegal activities, fight spam, and protect the rights and property of LightTag and others;
*   To communicate with you about offers and promotions offered by LightTag and others we think will be of interest to you, solicit your feedback, or keep you up to date on LightTag and our products; and

### Sharing Information

#### _How We Share Information_

We do not sell our users’ private personal information. We share information about you in the limited circumstances spelled out below and with appropriate safeguards on your privacy:

*   **Subsidiaries, Employees, and Independent Contractors:** We may disclose information about you to our subsidiaries, our employees, and individuals who are our independent contractors that need to know the information in order to help us provide our Services or to process the information on our behalf. We require our subsidiaries, employees, and independent contractors to follow this Privacy Policy for personal information that we share with them.
*   **Third Party Vendors:** We may share information about you with third party vendors who need to know information about you in order to provide their services to us. This group includes vendors that help us provide our Services to you (like payment providers that process your credit and debit card information) and those that help us understand and enhance our Services (like analytics providers). We require vendors to agree to privacy commitments in order to share information with them.
*   **As Required by Law:** We may disclose information about you in response to a subpoena, court order, or other governmental request. For more information on how we respond to requests for information about LightTag.io users, please see our [Legal Guidelines](https://en.support.LightTag.io/report-blogs/legal-guidelines/).
*   **To Protect Rights and Property:** We may disclose information about you when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of LightTag, third parties, or the public at large. For example, if we have a good faith belief that there is an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury, we may disclose information related to the emergency without delay.
*   **Business Transfers:** In connection with any merger, sale of company assets, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company, or in the unlikely event that LightTag goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would likely be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. If any of these events were to happen, this Privacy Policy would continue to apply to your information and the party receiving your information may continue to use your information, but only consistent with this Privacy Policy.
*   **With Your Consent:** We may share and disclose information with your consent or at your direction. For example, we may share your information with third parties with which you authorize us to do so, such as the social media services that you connect to your site through our Publicize feature.
*   **Aggregated and De-Identified Information:** We may share information that has been aggregated or reasonably de-identified, so that the information could not reasonably be used to identify you. For instance, we may publish aggregate statistics about the use of our Services.
*   **Published Support Requests:** And if you send us a request (for example, via a support email or one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish that request in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users.


### Security

While no online service is 100% secure, we work very hard to protect information about you against unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction, and take reasonable measures to do so.

### Choices

You have several choices available when it comes to information about you:

*   **Limit the Information that You Provide:** If you have an account with us, you can choose not to provide the optional account information, profile information, and transaction and billing information. Please keep in mind that if you do not provide this information, certain features of our Services–for example, paid, premium themes–may not be accessible.
*   **Opt-Out of Electronic Communications:** You may opt out of receiving promotional messages from us. Just follow the instructions in those messages. If you opt out of promotional messages, we may still send you other messages, like those about your account and legal notices.
*   **Set Your Browser to Reject Cookies:** At this time, LightTag does not respond to “do not track” signals across all of our Services. However, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove or reject browser cookies before using LightTag’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of LightTag’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

### Other Things You Should Know (Keep Reading!)

#### _Transferring Information_

LightTag is a worldwide service. By accessing or using the Services or otherwise providing information to us, you consent to the processing, transfer, and storage of information in and to the U.S. and other countries, which may have rights and protections that are different from those in your home country.

#### Analytics Services Provided by Others_

 Other parties may  provide analytics services via our Services. These analytics providers may set tracking technologies (like cookies) to collect information about your use of our Services and across other websites and online services. These technologies allow these third parties to recognize your device to compile information about you or others who use your device. This information allows us and other companies to, among other things, analyze and track usage or determine the popularity of certain content. Please note this Privacy Policy only covers the collection of information by LightTag and does not cover the collection of information by any third party advertisers or analytics providers.

#### _Third Party Software_

If you’d like to use third party software like plugins with our Services, please keep in mind that when you interact with them you may provide information about yourself to those third parties. We don’t own or control these third parties and they have their own rules about collection, use and sharing of information. You should review their rules and policies when installing and using third party software.
