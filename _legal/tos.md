### Terms of Service

### The gist:

We (the [folks at LightTag](http://LightTag.io/)) run an annotation platform called [LightTag.io](https://LightTag.io) and would **love** for you to use it. LightTag.io's basic service is a paid service. Our service is designed to give you as much control and ownership over what happens during the life of your annotation project and data assets as possible. However, be responsible in what you decide to annotate. In particular, make sure that none of the prohibited items (like copyright infringing texts  or serious threats of violence) appear on your website.


###  Thank You
